Week 1: Research and Topic Division

- Research: Gather foundational information on pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, A*).
- Divide Sections: Assign topics to each group member (e.g., graph theory basics, specific algorithms, applications).
- Initial Meeting: Discuss the presentation format, assign responsibilities, and set milestones for content creation.

Week 2: Content Creation and Understanding

- Develop Detailed Content: Each member works on their section of the presentation and thoroughly understands their algorithm or topic. 
  - Example: One person explains BFS, another DFS, etc.
- Team Check-in: Review everyone’s progress to ensure the content aligns and concepts are clear.
- Visual Aids: Begin brainstorming and gathering visual aids like graphs, flowcharts, and example problems.

Week 3: Draft Presentation and Review

- Combine Sections: Compile individual sections into one presentation draft.
- Mock Presentation: Perform a rough run-through to identify weak points and refine the flow.
- Feedback: Provide group feedback on each person’s explanation, clarity, and slide content.
- Revise: Make revisions to ensure each section is connected and coherent.

Week 4: Refinement and Practice

- Polish Slides: Finalize slides, ensuring they’re visually engaging and informative. Include video/graphical demonstrations of pathfinding.
- Practice: Each member practices their part, focusing on timing and delivery.
- Team Run-through: Perform the presentation together, working on transitions between sections.

Week 5: Final Rehearsal and Presentation

- Full Rehearsal: Complete the presentation from start to finish with strict timing. Focus on any last-minute changes.
- Q&A Preparation: Prepare for potential questions from the audience, like real-world applications or comparisons between algorithms.
- Presentation Day: Deliver the presentation with confidence!
