1. Introduction to Graph Theory

   - Definition of graphs (nodes and edges)
   - Types of graphs: Directed vs. undirected, weighted vs. unweighted
   - Applications of graphs in real-world scenarios (mazes, navigation, networks)

2. Basic Graph Traversal Algorithms

   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
     - How BFS works (FIFO queue)
     - Use cases: Shortest path in unweighted graphs
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
     - How DFS works (LIFO stack/recursion)
     - Use cases: Exploring all paths, detecting cycles

3. Shortest Path Algorithms

   - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
     - How it works: Priority queue, edge relaxation
     - Use cases: Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs
   - A* Algorithm
     - Introduction to heuristics (e.g., Manhattan distance)
     - How it improves upon Dijkstra’s by reducing search space

4. Advanced Pathfinding Topics

   - Greedy Best-First Search (an alternative heuristic-based search)
   - Bellman-Ford Algorithm (for graphs with negative edge weights)
   - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (for all-pairs shortest paths)

5. Optimization Techniques

   - Heuristics in A* for efficient search
   - Time and space complexity analysis for BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and A*

6. Applications of Pathfinding Algorithms

   - Game development (AI movement, dragon maze)
   - Robotics and navigation (robot path planning)
   - Networking (data routing)
   - AI search problems (prison break, puzzles)

7. Comparisons and Trade-offs

   - BFS vs DFS (advantages and disadvantages in different scenarios)
   - Dijkstra’s vs A* (efficiency in weighted graphs)
   - Time complexity comparisons: BFS (O(V + E)), DFS (O(V + E)), Dijkstra’s (O(V²) or O(E + V log V))

8. Real-world Example Problems

   - Dragon maze simulation (2D/3D grid with obstacles)
   - Prison break simulation (maze escape with guards as obstacles)

9. Visualization Techniques

   - Using animations to demonstrate algorithm progress (how paths are found)
   - Graphical tools like Graphviz, Pygame, or online graph simulation tools
